        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Hayden Larson, I was born and raised in the Twin City area in Minnesota. My core
            values include faith, family, and fun. I come from a family of 11 - 2 parents and 9 kids! (5 girls and 4
            boys) We always have fun when together. Some of my favorite things to do are to travel, play games, be
            active, and have some good conversation over a cup of coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
            I work for Slumberland Furnitrue in Human Resources - I love what I do and love the people I work with!
            I've been with Slumberland for 3 years and am lucky to work in a competitive environment where I can be
            tested and pushed to accomplish organizational goals but also be in a place where my well-being is top of
            mind for management - they do a great job caring for employees!
