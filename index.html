        Hi there! My name is Hayden Larson, I was born and raised in the Twin City area in Minnesota. My core values
        include faith, family, and fun. I come from a family of 11 - 2 parents and 9 kids! (5 girls and 4 boys) We
        always have fun when together. Some of my favorite things to do are to travel, play games, be active, and have
        some good conversation over a cup of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
        I work for Slumberland Furnitrue in Human Resources - I love what I do and love the people I work with! I've
        been with Slumberland for 3 years and am lucky to work in a competitive environment where I can be tested and
        pushed to accomplish organizational goals but also be in a place where my well-being is top of mind for
        management - they do a great job caring for employees!
    </p>
